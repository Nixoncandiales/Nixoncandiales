### Hi there 👋
- 🔭 I’m a Economics Ph.D. student at Emory currently working on labor, health and economics of education topics.

## What I do 👩🏼‍💻

- 🔦 [**overviewR**](https://github.com/cosimameyer/overviewR) [![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/overviewR)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=overviewR) is a neat CRAN package that helps you to get a quick overview of your data
- 🦠 [**Coro2vid-19**](https://github.com/dennis-hammerschmidt/Coro2vid-19) is a search engine that allows you to search > 20,000 scientific articles on coronaviruses for keywords, titles, and authors to discover relevant research in the field - you can try out the [ShinyApp here](https://cosima-meyer.shinyapps.io/coro2vid-19-shinyapp/)
- 🤖 [**Telegram bot**](https://github.com/dennis-hammerschmidt/telegram-bot) that sends you flashcards every morning and evening in Telegram using Python and AWS Lambda
- 👩🏼‍🎨 [**TidyTuesday**](https://github.com/cosimameyer/TidyTuesday) is like a playground for me to try out something new
- 👩🏼‍💻 Giving talks and workshops about [**ShinyApps**](https://github.com/cosimameyer/conflict-elections), [**NLP**](https://github.com/cosimameyer/nlp-talk), and [**package development**](https://cosimameyer.rbind.io/slides/overviewr/talk#1) 
- 🕊 In the past, I also **studied conflicts and development worldwide** and enjoyed teaching courses in computational social sciences and peace and conflict studies at the university. You can find a repository with my [teaching material](https://github.com/cosimameyer/complexities-in-analyzing-conflict-course-material) 👩🏼‍🏫 and material for a [ShinyApp](https://github.com/cosimameyer/conflict-elections) that I created ✨
